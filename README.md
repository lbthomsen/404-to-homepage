This is a fork of https://github.com/littlebizzy/404-to-homepage.

I created this fork because the original plugin insisted on huge notifications that had to be dismissed.  I am administrating quite a number of blogs and at the end of the day it was quicker to do this fork without the notifications than to dismiss the notifications on all the blogs.  I did try to encourage the author to - well - cut down on the notifications - but that turned a bit ugly.

Now, I am not going to upload this to Wordpress or anything like that.  If you want to use this version, simply clone in your plugins folder.
